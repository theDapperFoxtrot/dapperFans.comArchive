                <p>You found me! Thanks for taking the time to get to know me better. I'm Steve! A budding web developer who's passionate about technology, especially when it pertains to software engineering and design.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As a young gamer, I was quickly exposed to the hardware that powered many captivating experiences. My curiosity of the "HOW?!" was rampant, and growing up with the Internet in it was especially helpful in answering those questions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While I didn't have the appreciation of how crucial mathematics played a role in many of these experiences, I have retroactively studied and honed my abilities to nurture the developer I have always dreamed of being.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The more I learn, the more I discover the endless possibilities at my fingertips. I'm enthusiastic about the future, and excited by the constant need to learn and adapt to new ways of achieving amazing results.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I look forward to working with you!</p>
